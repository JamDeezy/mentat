MENTAT
======
A Mentat was a profession or discipline that was developed as a replacement to
the computers and thinking machines following the Butlerian Jihad that banned
the creation of machines in the human mind's image, just as the Spacing Guild
and the Bene Gesserit took up similar functions.

### USAGE:
